# SAR-Terrain-Colorizer
# SAR Image Colorization for Terrain Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on the colorization of grayscale Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to enhance terrain analysis.
By converting SAR images from grayscale to color, it becomes easier to interpret and analyze various geographical and structural features, aiding better decision-making in remote sensing applications.

# Key Highlights
Developed a deep learning-based model to automatically colorize grayscale SAR images.
Improved terrain visualization and feature distinction using learned color mappings.
Gained hands-on experience in image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques.

# Tech Stack
Python
PyTorch / TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib

# Dataset
Grayscale SAR images collected from [dataset name or source].
Corresponding color reference images for supervised learning (if applicable).
